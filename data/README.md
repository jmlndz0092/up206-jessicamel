## Arrest Data from 2010 to Present 
The data provided here is the arrest date, time, area name and ID, the arrest charge, as well as the age, gender, and race of the person being arrested. I plan on using this data to map out how close these arrests are being made in relation to the affordable housing units in the other data set and explore/determine what patterns exist in the areas where affordable housing exists.
