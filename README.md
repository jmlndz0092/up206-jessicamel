The purpose of this course it to build our understanding around spatial data analysis and develop our skills around the fundamentals of using Python programming.
# **Project Ideas**

# **Objectives for UP206A**
I do not have a technical background whatsoever, however, recently I've become more and more interested in learning about using spatial data to develop maps and telling a story through those maps. This past summer I was a research fellow for Stop LAPD Spying Coalition and I saw how one of their committees worked together to map out policing mechanisms like Operation LASER, Anchor Points and mark areas where police have murdered residents over the last few years in order to shed light on the communities of color LAPD has continued to target and terrorize. 

By taking this class, I want to develop my skills of assessing and analyzing spatial data in a way that allows me to capture and tell a story. I would also like to get comfortable and learn how to use Python.
